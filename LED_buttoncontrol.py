ESC204 Lab 1 Task D
Task: Light up external LED on button press.
'''
# Import libraries needed for blinking the LED
import board
import digitalio

# Configure the GPIO pin connected to the LED as a digital output
led = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.GP16)
led.direction = digitalio.Direction.OUTPUT

# Configure the GPIO pin connected to the button as a digital input
button = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.GP15)
button.direction = digitalio.Direction.INPUT
button.pull = digitalio.Pull.UP # Set internal pull-up resistor

# Print a message on the serial console
print('Hello! My LED is controlled by the button.')

# Loop so the code runs continuously
while True:
    led.value = not button.value #light up if button is pressed
